# Module 5: Monitoring and Guardrails

In this module, we will learn how to monitor our LLM and RAG system. We will compute metrics during the ingestion pipeline as well as regarding the chat behavior and history. In addition, we will integrate input guardrails to detect unwanted behaviour of user input and as well as output guardrails to ensure the LLM generated answers are not derailing.
