# OpenAI API Alternatives

OpenAI and GPT are not the only hosted LLMs that we can use.
There are other services that we can use

Let's build a list of such services that we can use instead of OpenAI


* [mistral.ai](mistral.ai) (5â‚¬ free credit on sign up)
* [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) (Free for personal use.
  Download open source models and run them locally on your machine.
  [Serves OpenAI compatible API locally via localhost](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/local-server))
* Add a service here
