# OpenAI API Alternatives

OpenAI and GPT are not the only hosted LLMs that we can use. 
There are other services that we can use

Let's build a list of such services that we can use instead of OpenAI


* [mistral.ai](https://mistral.ai) (5€ free credit on sign up)
* [Groq](https://console.groq.com) (can inference from open source LLMs with rate limits)
* [TogetherAI](https://api.together.ai) (can inference from variety of open source LLMs, 25$ free credit on sign up)
* [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/get-started/tutorial?lang=python) (2 months unlimited access)
* [OpenRouterAI](https://openrouter.ai/) (some small open-source models, such as Gemma 7B, are free)
* [HuggingFace API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index) (over 150,000 open-source models, rate-limited and free)
* [Cohere](https://cohere.com/) (provides a developer trail key which allows upto 100 reqs/min for generating, summarizing, and classifying text. Read more [here](https://cohere.com/blog/free-developer-tier-announcement))
