If the CONTEXT doesn\\'t contan the answer, return \"NONE\"\\n\\nQUESTION: How do I join the course after it has started?\\n\\nCONTEXT:\\n\\nSection: General course-related questions\\nQuestion: Course - Can I still join the course after the start date?\\nAnswer: Yes, even if you don\\'t register, you\\'re still eligible to submit the homeworks.\\nBe aware, however, that there will be deadlines for turning in the final projects. So don\\'t leave everything for the last minute.\\n\\nSection: General course-related questions\\nQuestion: Course - Can I follow the course after it finishes?\\nAnswer: Yes, we will keep all the materials after the course finishes, so you can follow the course at your own pace after it finishes.\\nYou can also continue looking at the homeworks and continue preparing for the next cohort. I guess you can also start working on your final capstone project.\\n\\nSection: General course-related questions\\nQuestion: Course - What can I do before the course starts?\\nAnswer: You can start by installing and setting up all the dependencies and requirements:\\nGoogle cloud account\\nGoogle Cloud SDK\\nPython 3 (installed with Anaconda)\\nTerraform\\nGit\\nLook over the prerequisites and syllabus to see if you are comfortable with these subjects.\\n\\nSection: General course-related questions\\nQuestion: How do I use Git / GitHub for this course?\\nAnswer: After you create a GitHub account, you should clone the course repo to your local machine using the process outlined in this video: Git for Everybody: How to Clone a Repository from GitHub\\nHaving this local repository on your computer will make it easy for you to access the instructors’ code and make pull requests (if you want to add your own notes or make changes to the course content).\\nYou will probably also create your own repositories that host your notes, versions of your file, to do this. Here is a great tutorial that shows you how to do this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository\\nRemember to ignore large database, .csv, and .gz files, and other files that should not be saved to a repository. Use .gitignore for this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore NEVER store passwords or keys in a git repo (even if that repo is set to private).\\nThis is also a great resource: https://dangitgit.com/\\n\\nSection: Workshop 1 - dlthub\\nQuestion: How do I install the necessary dependencies to run the code?\\nAnswer: Answer: To run the provided code, ensure that the \\'dlt[duckdb]\\' package is installed. You can do this by executing the provided installation command: !pip install dlt[duckdb]. If you’re doing it locally, be sure to also have duckdb pip installed (even before the duckdb package is loaded).'"
