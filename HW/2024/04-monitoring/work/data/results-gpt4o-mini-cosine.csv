"To structure your questions and answers for the course effectively, consider the following steps:

1. **Identify Your Topic**: Start by clearly defining the topic your question addresses. This helps in organizing related questions together.

2. **Be Specific**: Formulate your question to be specific and concise. This makes it easier for others to understand what information you're seeking.

3. **Provide Context**: If your question arises from a particular scenario or issue, briefly explain that context so that it can be better understood.

4. **Refer to Course Materials**: When formulating answers, reference course materials, such as course pages or specific modules, to provide a clear and credible response.

5. **Consider Audience**: Keep in mind who will be reading your questions and answers. Make sure the language and complexity match their understanding level.

6. **Format for Clarity**: Use bullet points or numbered lists for answers to enhance clarity and readability.

7. **Incorporate Feedback Loop**: Encourage readers to ask follow-up questions or provide feedback on the answers if clarity is lacking.

By structuring your questions and answers this way, you can ensure they are clear, relevant, and beneficial to others in the course.","Machine Learning Zoomcamp FAQ

"To read a dataset with Pandas in Windows, you may encounter issues if you use backslashes in the file path. In Python, the backslash (`\`) is treated as an escape character, which can cause conflicts. To avoid this, you should add an ""r"" before the file path so that Python treats it as a literal string instead. 

Here’s how you should load the file:

```python
df = pd.read_csv(r'C:\Users\username\Downloads\data.csv')
```

By using `r` in front of the path, you can successfully read the dataset without running into errors related to escape sequences.","How do I read the dataset with Pandas in Windows?

Unlike Linux/Mac OS, Windows uses the backslash (\) to navigate the files that cause the conflict with Python. The problem with using the backslash is that in Python, the '\' has a purpose known as an escape sequence.

"You might encounter a LinAlgError: Singular matrix error while following course videos due to a few reasons. Firstly, it can happen because not every matrix can be inverted, which is one of the main causes of a singular matrix error. Specifically, in the course, it often occurs when dealing with matrix multiplication, as the order in which matrices are multiplied is crucial. Make sure to respect the order of multiplication, as X.dot(Y) is not necessarily equal to Y.dot(X). 

Additionally, if you have performed the inverse of X once in your code and attempt to do it again, that could also trigger the error. It's a normal part of the learning process, and the reason for this error will be further explained in the Regularization video.","It’s possible that when you follow the videos, you’ll get a Singular Matrix error.

"Linear regression does not provide a ""perfect"" fit despite training on X_train because it is a simple model that cannot and should not fit the data 100%.

"A linear model handles a single feature by attempting to draw a line that best fits all the data points. However, because linear regression is a simple model, it does not aim to fit the data points perfectly. Instead, it provides a fit that reflects the overall trend in the data, leading to a prediction (y_pred) that may differ from the actual values (y). Achieving a perfect fit would indicate overfitting, which is not desirable as it could negatively impact the model's performance on unseen data.

"To resolve a ValueError related to different shapes or dimensions of arrays in a regression model, you can use the following approach:

"The error message ""could not convert string to float: 'Nissan'"" indicates that a machine learning model or function is expecting numerical input but is receiving a string instead. In this case, the model is trying to convert the car brand 'Nissan' into a numerical value, which cannot be done. 

To resolve this issue, you need to encode the categorical variable (in this case, car brands) into numerical values. One common method to accomplish this is one-hot encoding, which creates new binary columns for each unique category in the original data. For example, using pandas, you can apply one-hot encoding as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd
# Assuming 'data' is your DataFrame and 'brand' is the column with car brands
data_encoded = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['brand'])
```

This will replace the 'brand' column with separate columns for each brand (e.g., 'brand_Nissan', 'brand_Toyota', etc.), where each row has a 1 in the column corresponding to its brand and 0 in all other columns.","The error message “could not convert string to float: ‘Nissan’” typically occurs when a machine learning model or function is expecting numerical input, but receives a string instead.

"Mutual information score is used only for categorical or discrete variables because it calculates the relationship between such variables. Continuous variables, like the median_house_value in the homework, need to be converted to a binary format (discrete) to be suitable for this calculation. If continuous variables are left as they are, the mutual information score could still be calculated, but it would require subjective binning, which is not ideal. Thus, mutual information score is not calculated with continuous variables.","Solution: Mutual Information score calculates the relationship between categorical variables or discrete variables. So in the homework, because the target which is median_house_value is continuous, we had to change it to binary format which in other words, makes its values discrete as either 0 or 1.

np.random.seed(3)
df_random = pd.DataFrame(data=np.random.random(3*3).reshape(3,3))

"You can use the Scikit-learn library to verify precision, recall, and F1-score. Specifically, you can use the following functions:

1. `precision_score`
2. `recall_score`
3. `f1_score`
4. `precision_recall_fscore_support`

Here's an example of how to compute these metrics:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, precision_recall_fscore_support

precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred, average='binary')
recall = recall_score(y_true, y_pred, average='binary')
f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='binary')
precision, recall, fscore, support = precision_recall_fscore_support(y_val, y_val_pred, zero_division=0)
```

These methods provide a convenient way to calculate the metrics without needing to define true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives separately.","I am getting multiple thresholds with the same F1 score, does this indicate I am doing something wrong or is there a method for choosing?

"You can find methods to obtain precision, recall, and F1-score using scikit-learn by using the following functions:

1. **For individual metrics**:
   - Precision: 
     ```python
     from sklearn.metrics import precision_score
     precision = precision_score(y_true, y_pred, average='binary')
     ```
   - Recall:

   - F1-Score: 
     ```python
     from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
     f1 = f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average='binary')
     ```

2. **For all metrics at once**:
   - You can use `precision_recall_fscore_support`:
     ```python
     from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_fscore_support
     precision, recall, fscore, support = precision_recall_fscore_support(y_val, y_val_pred, zero_division=0)

3. **To obtain a complete report** with precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy simultaneously:
   - Use `classification_report`:
     ```python
     from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
     print(classification_report(y_true, y_pred))

Did you try using a different random_state? From my understanding, KFold just makes N (which is equal to n_splits) separate pairs of datasets (train+val).

Changing the random state makes a difference in my case too, but not whether it is inside or outside the for loop. I think I have got the answer. kFold = KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle = True, random_state = 1)  is just a generator object and it contains only the information n_splits, shuffle and random_state. The k-fold splitting actually happens in the next for loop for train_idx, val_idx in kFold.split(df_full_train): . So it doesn't matter where we generate the object, before or after the first loop. It will generate the same information. But from the programming point of view, it is better to do it before the loop. No point doing it again and again inside the loop

In case of KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=1) and C= [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10], it is better to loop through the different values of Cs as the video explained. I had separate train() and predict() functions, which were reused after dividing the dataset via KFold. The model ran about 10 minutes and provided a good score.
(Ani Mkrtumyan)",d30fc29d,Why is it better to create the KFold generator object before the loop rather than inside it?,machine-learning-zoomcamp,0.69275856
"The loop should iterate through the different C values as described in the video to evaluate the performance of the model under varying regularization strengths. Each C value represents a hyperparameter that affects how the model learns from the training data—smaller values introduce more regularization, potentially resulting in a simpler model that may underfit, while larger values reduce regularization, allowing for a more complex model that may overfit.

By looping through these C values, cross-validation allows for a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance for each configuration, identifying the best C value that balances model complexity and generalization. This iterative process, as noted in the context, ultimately improves the model's performance, which was observed to run efficiently and produce a good score in the example provided.","What does this line do?

Larger ""C"" values: They reduce the regularization effect, allowing the model to fit the training data more closely, potentially overfitting. This is because it penalizes misclassification less severely, allowing the model to prioritize getting training examples correct.

"You can evaluate a model using scikit-learn metrics by utilizing various functions from the `sklearn.metrics` module. Here are the key metrics you can compute:

1. **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions.
   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
   accuracy = accuracy_score(y_val, y_pred)
   ```

2. **Precision**: Indicates the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import precision_score
   precision = precision_score(y_val, y_pred)
   ```

3. **Recall**: Reflects the proportion of true positives among all actual positive instances.
   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import recall_score
   recall = recall_score(y_val, y_pred)
   ```

4. **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful for imbalanced classes.
   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import f1_score
   f1 = f1_score(y_val, y_pred)
   ```

5. **ROC AUC**: Measures the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, providing insight into the model's performance across various thresholds.
   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
   roc_auc = roc_auc_score(y_val, y_pred)
   ```

You can print these metrics as follows:
```python
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
print(f'Precision: {precision}')
print(f'Recall: {recall}')
print(f'F1-Score: {f1}')
print(f'ROC AUC: {roc_auc}')
```

Olga Rudakova",927b5e09,What type of classification is Stratified k-fold used for?,machine-learning-zoomcamp,0.8609704
"Maintaining class balance in multiclass classification is important because it ensures that each class is represented proportionally in the training and validation sets during the model evaluation process. This balance allows for more reliable and effective model performance assessment, as it helps avoid biases that could arise from having too few samples from certain classes, ensuring that the model learns to generalize well across all classes. Stratified k-fold cross-validation, for example, achieves this by returning folds that contain approximately the same percentage of samples from each class.","For multiclass classification it is important to keep class balance when you split the data set.

"To ensure the 'Virtual Machine Platform' feature is activated on Windows, follow these steps: 

1. Search for ""features"" in the Windows search bar.
2. In the ""Windows Features"" window, check if the 'Virtual Machine Platform' checkbox is selected.
3. Make sure your system's BIOS is capable of virtualization, which is usually the default setting. 

If these conditions are met, the 'Virtual Machine Platform' should be activated.","It is quite simple, and you can follow these instructions here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYlgUDKKK5A&ab_channel=NeuralNine
Make sure that you have “Virtual Machine Platform” feature activated in your Windows “Features”. To do that, search “features” in the research bar and see if the checkbox is selected. You also need to make sure that your system (in the bios) is able to virtualize. This is usually the case.
In the Microsoft Store: look for ‘Ubuntu’ or ‘Debian’ (or any linux distribution you want) and install it
Once it is downloaded, open the app and choose a username and a password (secured one). When you type your password, nothing will show in the window, which is normal: the writing is invisible.
You are now inside of your linux system. You can test some commands such as “pwd”. You are not in your Windows system.
To go to your windows system: you need to go back two times with cd ../.. And then go to the “mnt” directory with cd mnt. If you list here your files, you will see your disks. You can move to the desired folder, for example here I moved to the ML_Zoomcamp folder:
Python should be already installed but you can check it by running sudo apt install python3 command.
You can make your actual folder your default folder when you open your Ubuntu terminal with this command : echo ""cd ../../mnt/your/folder/path"" >> ~/.bashrc
You can disable bell sounds (when you type something that does not exist for example) by modifying the inputrc file with this command: sudo vim /etc/inputrc
You have to uncomment the set bell-style none line -> to do that, press the “i” keyboard letter (for insert) and go with your keyboard to this line. Delete the # and then press the Escape keyboard touch and finally press “:wq” to write (it saves your modifications) then quit.
You can check that your modifications are taken into account by opening a new terminal (you can pin it to your task bar so you do not have to go to the Microsoft app each time).
You will need to install pip by running this command sudo apt install python3-pip

"The `--rm` flag is used when running Docker containers to automatically remove the container upon exit. This is important because it helps prevent the accumulation of stopped containers, which can take up disk space. Best practice suggests not keeping abandoned containers in your system. The images themselves remain until manually removed, but using `--rm` ensures that any containers that are no longer needed are cleaned up immediately, keeping your environment tidy and saving storage space.","What is the reason we don’t want to keep the docker image in our system and why do we need to run docker containers with `--rm` flag?

"To resolve an error during the installation of a Pipfile inside a Docker container, you can try the following steps:

1. First, run the command `pipenv lock` to update the Pipfile.lock. If this does not resolve the issue, proceed to the next step.

   ```
   RUN pipenv install --system --deploy --ignore-pipfile
   ```

- **Option 1:** Delete the Pipfile.lock using the command `rm Pipfile.lock`, then rebuild the lock by running `pipenv lock` from your terminal before retrying the Docker build command.

- **Option 2:** If Option 1 does not work, you can remove the pipenv environment along with the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock. Use the commands:

"To resolve the NotSupportedError in section 5, you can take the following steps:

1. **Downgrade the protobuf package**: The recommended version is 3.20.1. You can do this by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pipenv install protobuf==3.20.1
   ```

2. **Regenerate your Protobuf files**: If you have access to the source files and can regenerate them, ensure that you use `protoc` version 3.19.0 or higher.

3. **Alternative workaround**: If you cannot regenerate your protos, you can either downgrade the protobuf package to version 3.20.x or lower, or set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python

"Bagging and boosting are two techniques used in ensemble algorithms. 

Bagging, which stands for ""Bootstrap Aggregation,"" involves creating multiple training datasets from the original dataset by sampling with replacement (bootstrapping). Each model is trained on these different datasets in parallel, and their predictions are combined (aggregated) to produce the final output. For example, in Random Forest, the output can be the average of the predictions. Bagging helps to decrease variance and is robust against overfitting.

Boosting, on the other hand, is a sequential process where each model is trained based on the errors of the previous model. In this method, misclassified observations are assigned higher weights, which helps subsequent models to focus on correcting the errors made by prior models. XGBoost is an example of a boosting algorithm. Boosting reduces bias and generally provides higher accuracy than bagging, but it can be more prone to overfitting. 

Overall, while bagging focuses on reducing variance by averaging multiple models trained in parallel, boosting aims to improve model accuracy by sequentially adjusting weights based on errors from previous models.","For ensemble algorithms, during the week 6, one bagging algorithm and one boosting algorithm were presented: Random Forest and XGBoost, respectively.
Random Forest trains several models in parallel. The output can be, for example, the average value of all the outputs of each model. This is called bagging.
XGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.
Note that boosting is not necessarily better than bagging.

Bagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.
Boosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max.

"If you encounter a `ValueError` about the channel dimension being `None` when reloading a saved model, it typically means that the number of channels was not explicitly specified in the Input layer of the model. To fix this, ensure that your model architecture explicitly defines the number of channels. For example, specify the channel size in the Input layer like this:

```python
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(input_size, input_size, 3))
```

This way, the model architecture will have the channel dimension properly defined when you reload the model.","While doing:
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('model_saved.h5')
If you get an error message like this:
ValueError: The channel dimension of the inputs should be defined. The input_shape received is (None, None, None, None), where axis -1 (0-based) is the channel dimension, which found to be `None`.
Solution:
Saving a model (either yourself via model.save() or via checkpoint when save_weights_only = False) saves two things: The trained model weights (for example the best weights found during training) and the model architecture.  If the number of channels is not explicitly specified in the Input layer of the model, and is instead defined as a variable, the model architecture will not have the value in the variable stored. Therefore when the model is reloaded, it will complain about not knowing the number of channels. See the code below, in the first line, you need to specify number of channels explicitly:
# model architecture:
inputs = keras.Input(shape=(input_size, input_size, 3))
base = base_model(inputs, training=False)

"When using `from_logits` to get results in a Keras model, the two values represent the logits for each of the class labels. Specifically, when a Keras model predicts binary labels with `from_logits`, it will output two values: the first value corresponds to the logit for class 0, and the second value corresponds to the logit for class 1. This means that the model provides unnormalized scores for each class, which can be converted into probabilities using a softmax function.","The command to read folders in the dataset in the tensorflow source code is:
for subdir in sorted(os.listdir(directory)):
…
Reference: https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/keras/preprocessing/image.py, line 563
This means folders will be read in alphabetical order. For example, in the case of a folder named dino, and another named dragon, dino will read first and will have class label 0, whereas dragon will be read in next and will have class label 1.
When a Keras model predicts binary labels, it will only return one value, and this is the probability of class 1 in case of sigmoid activation function in the last dense layer with 2 neurons. The probability of class 0 can be found out by:
prob(class(0)) = 1- prob(class(1))
In case of using from_logits to get results, you will get two values for each of the labels.

"The values predicted by a neural network can be interpreted as probabilities for the classes. It's common to treat these predictions as likelihoods, especially in the context of classification tasks. For example, using the `predict_proba` function provides probabilities for each class, which are more informative than simply returning class labels (0 or 1) as done by `predict(X)`. This implies that while the actual predicted values are relevant, they should often be viewed as probabilities that indicate the likelihood of an instance belonging to a particular class.","It's fine, some small changes are expected

Added by Andrii Larkin",879c1ec0,What determines the parameter count for a Conv2d layer?,machine-learning-zoomcamp,0.7369232
"The output shape of a Conv2d layer is derived based on the input shape, the kernel size, and the number of filters. For instance, if you define a Conv2d layer as follows:

```python
tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(150, 150, 3))
```

This means the input image has a shape of 150x150 pixels with 3 channels (RGB). The kernel size is 3x3, and there are 32 filters.

To calculate the output shape, we use the formula for the spatial dimensions after applying the convolution operation:

\[
\text{Output Height} = \left(\frac{\text{Input Height} - \text{Kernel Height}}{\text{Stride}} + 1\right)
\]
\[
\text{Output Width} = \left(\frac{\text{Input Width} - \text{Kernel Width}}{\text{Stride}} + 1\right)
\]

Assuming the default stride of 1, the output shape is computed as:

\[
\text{Output Height} = \left(\frac{150 - 3}{1} + 1\right) = 148
\]
\[
\text{Output Width} = \left(\frac{150 - 3}{1} + 1\right) = 148
\]

Thus, the output shape becomes (None, 148, 148, 32), where ""None"" represents the batch size, and 32 is the number of filters. This is confirmed by the model summary which shows the output shape as:

```

"Your lambda function may pass local tests but fail on a running Docker instance due to the handling of data types in the responses. Specifically, if your model returns individual estimation values as numpy float32, you will encounter serialization issues because these values are not JSON serializable. When running in a Docker instance, you need to convert these numpy float32 values to base-Python floats before returning them. This can be done using `float()` as shown in the example: 

```python
preds = [float(interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0]), 
         float(1-interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0])]
```

Without this conversion, the Docker instance will throw an error such as `{""errorMessage"": ""Unable to marshal response: Object of type float32 is not JSON serializable"", ...}`. Thus, always ensure that your responses are properly formatted for JSON serialization in the Docker environment.","Problem:
While passing local testing of the lambda function without issues, trying to test the same input with a running docker instance results in an error message like
{‘errorMessage’: ‘Unable to marshal response: Object of type float32 is not JSON serializable’, ‘errorType’: ‘Runtime.MarshalError’, ‘requestId’: ‘f155492c-9af2-4d04-b5a4-639548b7c7ac’, ‘stackTrace’: []}
This happens when a model (in this case the dino vs dragon model) returns individual estimation values as numpy float32 values (arrays). They need to be converted individually to base-Python floats in order to become “serializable”.
Solution:
In my particular case, I set up the dino vs dragon model in such a way as to return a label + predicted probability for each class as follows (below is a two-line extract of function predict() in the lambda_function.py):
preds = [interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0], \
1-interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0]]
In which case the above described solution will look like this:
preds = [float(interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0]), \
float(1-interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0])]

"To convert numpy float32 values to make them serializable in your serverless application, you need to convert them individually to base-Python floats. Here's how you can do that:

Instead of returning numpy float32 values directly, you can modify your prediction code as follows:

```python
preds = [float(interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0]), 
         float(1 - interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0])]
```

This ensures that the values returned are base-Python floats, which are JSON serializable.","Problem:
While passing local testing of the lambda function without issues, trying to test the same input with a running docker instance results in an error message like

This happens when a model (in this case the dino vs dragon model) returns individual estimation values as numpy float32 values (arrays). They need to be converted individually to base-Python floats in order to become “serializable”.
Solution:
In my particular case, I set up the dino vs dragon model in such a way as to return a label + predicted probability for each class as follows (below is a two-line extract of function predict() in the lambda_function.py):

"To run the Docker image as a container for AWS Lambda, you can use the following command, ensuring your Docker image is built upon the base AWS Lambda image (e.g., `FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.10`):

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 9000:8080 name
```

This command runs the image as a container and starts an endpoint locally at:

```
localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations

You can then post an event to this endpoint using a curl command, such as:

```bash
curl -XPOST ""http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations"" -d '{}'
```

For example, to test using a specific URL, use:

* For Windows:

```bash
curl -XPOST ""http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations"" -d ""{\""url\"": \""https://habrastorage.org/webt/rt/d9/dh/rtd9dhsmhwrdezeldzoqgijdg8a.jpeg\""}""

You should convert the float32 values returned by your model to base-Python floats. For example, if your function returns `preds` as numpy float32 values, modify your lambda_handler() to convert them like this:

```python
preds = [float(interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0]), 
         float(1 - interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)[0][0])]

"If you are unable to run `pip install tflite_runtime` from GitHub wheel links, you can try the following solutions:

1. **Check OS and Python Versions**: Ensure that your OS and Python version are compatible with the available `tflite_runtime` versions, which can be found here: [TFLite Runtime Versions](https://google-coral.github.io/py-repo/tflite-runtime/). If your combination is missing, it won't work.

2. **Use Alternative Links**: You can explore alternative pre-built wheels available on this GitHub repository: [tflite-aws-lambda](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda/tree/main/tflite). For instance, you might try installing a specific wheel directly:
   ```bash
   pip install https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/tflite-aws-lambda/raw/main/tflite/tflite_runtime-2.7.0-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl
   ```

3. **Run in a Virtual Machine**: If you continue facing issues, you could use a virtual machine with a compatible Linux system (for example, with VM VirtualBox), or try using cloud services like Vertex AI Workbench on Google Cloud Platform, which provides notebooks and terminals.

4. **Python Version**: If you are attempting to install within a `pipenv` environment and receive an error, it may be due to using Python 3.10. Try downgrading to Python 3.9, as `tflite_runtime` is known to work with that version.

5. **Using an Alternative Approach**: If none of these options work, consider using the TFLite included in TensorFlow for local development and use Docker for testing.

config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True
session = tf.compat.v1.Session(config=config)

"To configure TensorFlow to solve memory allocation issues on your machine, you can try the following methods:

1. For general memory allocation errors, add the following code snippet at the beginning of your notebook:
   ```python
   config = tf.compat.v1.ConfigProto()
   config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True
   session = tf.compat.v1.Session(config=config)
   ```
   This configuration allows TensorFlow to allocate memory as needed and may resolve most issues related to memory allocation.

2. If you are using an Nvidia GPU, you can explicitly set memory growth with this code snippet:
   ```python
   physical_devices = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')
   try:
       tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(physical_devices[0], True)
   except:
       # Invalid device or cannot modify virtual devices once initialized.
       pass
   ```
   This will enable TensorFlow to allocate memory dynamically as required, which can help prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors.

2. **Prune the System**: After removing the Docker images, run the command `docker system prune`. This command removes all unused data, which can help recover the storage space consumed by stopped containers and dangling images.

"Emails are hashed in the peer review process by using the SHA-1 hashing algorithm. To obtain the hash value of your email address, you can use the following Python code:

```python
from hashlib import sha1

def compute_hash(email):

"To avoid a pickle attribute error when using waitress with your Docker container, you should move your custom column transformer class into a separate module. Then, import this class in both the script that saves the model (e.g., `train.py`) and the script that loads the model (e.g., `predict.py`). This prevents the pickle error that occurs because it references the class in the global namespace (`__main__.<custom_class>`) when using waitress, which is different from when Flask is used directly.","When running a docker container with waitress serving the app.py for making predictions, pickle will throw an error that can't get attribute <name_of_class> on module __main__.
This does not happen when Flask is used directly, i.e. not through waitress.
The problem is that the model uses a custom column transformer class, and when the model was saved, it was saved from the __main__ module (e.g. python train.py). Pickle will reference the class in the global namespace (top-level code): __main__.<custom_class>.

"The reason pickle works with Flask but not with waitress for your custom column transformer class is that when the model was saved, it was done from the `__main__` module (for example, using `python train.py`). Pickle tries to reference the class in the global namespace as `__main__.<custom_class>`. 

When using Flask directly (without waitress), the class is found in the same namespace as the one used when the model was saved. However, when using waitress, it loads the `predict_app` module, which causes pickle to look for `__main__.<custom_class>`, but that doesn't exist in this context. 

The solution is to place the custom column transformer class into a separate module and import it in both the script that saves the model and the script that loads it. This way, both scripts will reference the class correctly, regardless of whether they are run with Flask or waitress.","When running a docker container with waitress serving the app.py for making predictions, pickle will throw an error that can't get attribute <name_of_class> on module __main__.

"To convert the `day_of_the_month` and `month_of_the_year` columns into a single `day_of_the_year` column in pandas, follow these steps:

1. Convert the `day_of_the_month` column from integer to string:
   ```python
   df['day_of_the_month'] = df['day_of_the_month'].map(str)
   ```

2. Convert the `month_of_the_year` column from strings (jan, feb, ..., dec) to corresponding integers (1, 2, ..., 12) using `map()`.

"To transform the `month_of_the_year` values like 'jan' and 'feb' into integers in pandas, you can use the `map()` function to convert these string values into their corresponding integer representations. Here's how you can do it:

1. Convert the `month_of_the_year` column from strings (e.g., 'jan', 'feb', etc.) to integers (1, 2, ..., 12) using the `map()` function.
2. Combine this with the `day_of_the_month` to create a datetime object.
3. Finally, you can use the `dt.dayofyear` to get the day of the year as an integer.

Here’s a simplified version of the solution:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'day_of_the_month': [1, 2, 20],
    'month_of_the_year': ['jan', 'feb', 'dec']
})

# Convert day_of_the_month to string
df['day_of_the_month'] = df['day_of_the_month'].map(str)

# Map month names to numbers
month_mapping = {'jan': 1, 'feb': 2, 'mar': 3, 'apr': 4, 'may': 5,
                 'jun': 6, 'jul': 7, 'aug': 8, 'sep': 9, 'oct': 10,
                 'nov': 11, 'dec': 12}
df['month'] = df['month_of_the_year'].map(month_mapping)

# Create a formatted date
df['date_formatted'] = pd.to_datetime(dict(year=2055, month=df['month'], day=df['day_of_the_month']))

# Get the day of the year

"The order is important in matrix multiplication because changing the order can produce matrices of different sizes and usually different values. For example, multiplying matrix A (m x n) by matrix B (n x p) yields a matrix C (m x p), whereas multiplying B (n x p) by A (m x n) yields a different matrix D (n x n). This fundamental difference highlights that the result of matrix multiplication is dependent on the multiplication order.","When multiplying matrices, the order of multiplication is important.
For example:
A (m x n) * B (n x p) = C (m x p)

"When multiplying matrices, changing the order of multiplication affects the result. Specifically, if you have two matrices A (m x n) and B (n x p), multiplying them as A * B will yield a result C (m x p). If you change the order and multiply B * A instead, you will get a different result D (n x n), which is a matrix of a different size and usually has different values. Thus, the order of multiplication is important and must be maintained to get the correct results.","When multiplying matrices, the order of multiplication is important.

"The size of the resulting matrix changes with the order of multiplication. Specifically, if you have matrix A of size (m x n) and matrix B of size (n x p), multiplying A by B gives you a resulting matrix C of size (m x p). However, if you reverse the order and multiply B by A, you get a resulting matrix D of size (n x n). Therefore, the order in which matrices are multiplied significantly affects both the size and the values of the resulting matrices.","When multiplying matrices, the order of multiplication is important.

Chunking: When you do need all the data, you can read and process it in chunks that do fit in the memory.
Optimizing data types: Pandas’ automatic data type inference (when reading data in) might result in e.g. float64 precision being used to represent integers, which wastes space. You might achieve substantial memory reduction by optimizing the data types.
