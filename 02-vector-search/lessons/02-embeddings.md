# Embeddings

Before we can do vector search, we need to turn our text into vectors.
We call this process embedding: we embed text into a vector space. The
vectors we get back are also called "embeddings."

## Word embeddings and sentence embeddings

This idea comes from
[word2vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec). The model learns to
place words as points in a multi-dimensional space. Words with similar
meanings land close to each other.

Imagine a 2D space where "enroll" and "join" are near each other and
"Docker" is far away:

```text
        · enroll
       · join
                   · Docker
```

The same idea works for entire sentences:

```text
Q1: "I just discovered the course. Can I still join it?"
Q2: "I just found out about the program. Can I still enroll?"

These two are close - they mean the same thing.

Q3: "How do I run Docker on Windows?"

This one is far away from Q1 and Q2.
```

Now imagine all 1200 documents in our FAQ dataset. Each one becomes a
point in this space. When a user asks a question, we embed it into the
same space and find the closest documents. Those nearest neighbors are
our search results.

The model encodes the whole sentence, not the words in isolation. So it
can tell apart the same word in different contexts.

Take the word "judge." In "the judge ruled out the possibility of crime"
(legal) it gets one vector. In "LLM-as-a-judge approach to evaluate
LLMs" (ML evaluation) it gets a different one. The surrounding context
changes the embedding.

So an embedding model takes text in and returns a fixed-length array of
numbers. We train it so that texts with similar meanings get similar
vectors.

We'll use [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/), a popular
open-source library for embeddings. It runs locally on your machine, so
there are no API costs.

## Installing sentence-transformers

Install the library:

```bash
uv add sentence-transformers
```

This also pulls in PyTorch under the hood, so it downloads a lot. You'll
see CUDA and other Nvidia packages go by. That's fine for experiments,
and we'll trim it down for production in a
[later lesson](09-onnx-embedder.md).

## Choosing a model

Sentence-transformers supports many models. The right one depends on
your task, your language, and the resources you have. Larger models are
usually slower, so for our FAQ dataset of short English texts a small
model is enough. Try a few on your own data and keep the one that works
best.

We'll use `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`:

- 384-dimensional vectors (compact)
- Fast on CPU
- Good quality for general English text
- Uses cosine similarity (we'll explain this below)

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
```

The first time you run this, it downloads the model (~80 MB) and the
tokenizer from HuggingFace. The tokenizer turns text into something the
model can read. After that, both load from a local cache.

## Trying it with simple examples

Let's see how embeddings work on a few examples.

We'll start with a query:

```python
q1 = "Can I still join the course after the start date?"
v1 = model.encode(q1)
```

`v1` is a vector, an array of 384 numbers. Each number stands for some
concept the model learned. We can't read off what any one of them means.
But two vectors with similar values point to texts about similar things.

Encode our document:

```python
d  = "You don't need to register. You're accepted. You can also just start learning and submitting homework without registering."
dv = model.encode(d)
```

Next, we compare the query against the document using dot product:

```python
v1.dot(dv)
```

We get 0.32.

Now we try an unrelated query:

```python
q2 = "How to install Docker on Windows?"
v2 = model.encode(q2)
```

This time the similarity with the document should be much smaller:

```python
v2.dot(dv)
```

And we get 0.01.

The first score for `q1` vs `d` (0.32) is higher, so that query is more
similar to the document about registration. The second score for `q2`
vs `d` sits near 0, because installing Docker has nothing to do with
registration. A score near 0 means the two vectors are about as
different as they can be.

That's the whole idea behind vector search: similar texts get similar
vectors, and a dot product tells us how similar.

## Cosine similarity

The `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model outputs normalized vectors - vectors with
unit length. When both vectors are normalized, the dot product equals
cosine similarity. That's why the model documentation says it "uses
cosine similarity."

Cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors, ignoring
their length:

- 1.0 = same direction (similar)
- 0.0 = perpendicular (unrelated)
- -1.0 = opposite direction (opposite meaning)

Formally, if `theta` is the angle between two vectors, cosine similarity
is `cos(theta)`:

- `cos(0) = 1` - vectors point in the same direction
- `cos(90) = 0` - vectors are perpendicular
- `cos(180) = -1` - vectors point in opposite directions

Because our vectors are normalized, the dot product gives us cosine
similarity directly. This is why we can use `v1.dot(dv)` to compare
texts.

In practice, we rarely get cosine similarity below 0. The embedding
model maps text to a region of the vector space where most vectors
have positive components. There's no concept of "opposite meaning"
that maps to a vector pointing the other way.
