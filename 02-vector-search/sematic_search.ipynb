    "# Vector Search with Qdrant\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vector Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector search is the backbone of the modern internet, whether you notice it or not. It powers recommendation engines, chatbots, AI agents, and even major search engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, traditional keyword search works by matching exact words. This works well when you know the precise keywords present in the data. But what happens when there are no keywords? What if you're searching through images, audio, video or code, or even cross-modally?\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, even in text-heavy documents, keyword search struggles to capture context and meaning. The same idea can be phrased in countless ways, so it is completely unfeasible to compare/search for using keyword-based methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of relying on exact matches, vector search retrieves information based on semantic similarity measured numerically between vectorized data representations (embeddings). It recognizes patterns and relationships between concepts, enabling search systems to retrieve the most relevant content, even when the phrasing differs, terminology varies, or no explicit keywords exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Qdrant\n",
    "\n",
    "[Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) is an **open-source** vector search engine, a dedicated solution built in Rust for scalable vector search. \n",
    "If you're wondering why you might need a dedicated solution for vector search, we’ve addressed that in the article [\"Built for Vector Search\"](https://qdrant.tech/articles/dedicated-vector-search/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To TLDR:\n",
    "- To make production-level vector search at scale;\n",
    "- To stay in sync with the latest trends and best practices;\n",
    "- To fully use vector search capabilities (including those beyond simple similarity search).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we’ll give you a small sneak peek into semantic (vector) search with Qdrant and encourage you to play around & see if it fits your needs!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions about vector search in Qdrant, feel free to reach out in our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/G7PQU6Cy).\n"

    "## Step 0: Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Qdrant is fully open-source, which means you can run it in multiple ways depending on your needs.  \n",
    "You can self-host it on your own infrastructure, deploy it on Kubernetes, or run it in managed Cloud.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to run a Qdrant instance in a Docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "All you need to do is pull the image and start the container using the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker pull qdrant/qdrant\n",
    "\n",
    "docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \\\n",
    "   -v \"$(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z\" \\\n",
    "   qdrant/qdrant\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line in the `docker run` command mounts local storage to keep your data persistent.\n",
    "So even if you restart or delete the container, your data will still be stored locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 6333 – REST API port\n",
    "- 6334 – gRPC API port\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you explore your data visually, Qdrant provides a built-in **Web UI**, available in both Qdrant Cloud and local instances.\n",
    "You can use it to inspect collections, check system health, and even run simple queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're running Qdrant in Docker, the Web UI is available at http://localhost:6333/dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Required Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "In the environment you created specifically for this course, we’ll install:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `qdrant-client` package. We'll be using the Python client, but Qdrant also offers official clients for JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, and Rust, so you can choose the best fit for your own projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `fastembed` package - an optimized embedding (data vectorization) solution designed specifically for Qdrant. Make sure you install version `>= 1.14.2` to use the **local inference** with Qdrant."

IMPORTANT: Download the Cloud Storage connector for Hadoop here: https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/connectors/cloud-storage#clusters\\nAs the name implies, this .jar file is what essentially connects PySpark with your GCS\\n2.) Move the .jar file to your Spark file directory. I installed Spark using homebrew on my MacOS machine and I had to create a /jars directory under \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/apache-spark/3.2.1/ (where my spark dir is located)\\n3.) In your Python script, there are a few extra classes you’ll have to import:\\nimport pyspark\\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\\nfrom pyspark.conf import SparkConf\\nfrom pyspark.context import SparkContext\\n4.) You must set up your configurations before building your SparkSession. Here’s my code snippet:\\nconf = SparkConf() \\\\\\n.setMaster(\\'local[*]\\') \\\\\\n.setAppName(\\'test\\') \\\\\\n.set(\"spark.jars\", \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/apache-spark/3.2.1/jars/gcs-connector-hadoop3-latest.jar\") \\\\\\n.set(\"spark.hadoop.google.cloud.auth.service.account.enable\", \"true\") \\\\\\n.set(\"spark.hadoop.google.cloud.auth.service.account.json.keyfile\", \"path/to/google_credentials.json\")\\nsc = SparkContext(conf=conf)\\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.AbstractFileSystem.gs.impl\",  \"com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFS\")\\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.gs.impl\", \"com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFileSystem\")\\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.gs.auth.service.account.json.keyfile\", \"path/to/google_credentials.json\")\\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.gs.auth.service.account.enable\", \"true\")\\n5.) Once you run that, build your SparkSession with the new parameters we’d just instantiated in the previous step:\\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\\\\n.config(conf=sc.getConf()) \\\\\\n.getOrCreate()\\n6.)

However, when executing the pipeline as a whole, some blocks fail.\\nA: I have the following key-value pair in io_config.yaml file configured but still Mage blocks failed to generate OAuth and authenticate with GCP: GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACC_KEY_FILEPATH: \"{{ env_var(\\'GCP_CREDENTIALS\\') }}\". The GCP_CREDENTIALS variable holds the full path to the service account key\\'s JSON file. Adding the following line within the failed code block resolved the issue: os.environ[\\'GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS\\'] = os.environ.get(\\'GCP_CREDENTIALS\\').\\nThis occurs because the path to profiles.yml is not correctly specified. You can rectify this by:\\n“export DBT_PROFILES_DBT=path/to/profiles.yml”\\nEg., /home/src/magic-zoomcamp/dbt/project_name/\\nDo the similar for DBT_PROJECT_DIR if getting similar issue with dbt_project.yml.\\nOnce DIRs are set,:\\n“dbt debug –config-dir”\\nThis would update your paths. To maintain same path across sessions, use the path variables in your .env file.\\nTo add triggers in mage pipelines via CLI, you can create a trigger of type API, and copy the API links.\\nEg. link: http://localhost:6789/api/pipeline_schedules/10/pipeline_runs/f3a1a4228fc64cfd85295b668c93f3b2\\nThen create a trigger.py as such:\\nimport os\\nimport requests\\nclass MageTrigger:\\nOPTIONS = {\\n\"<pipeline_name>\": {\\n\"trigger_id\": 10,\\n\"key\": \"f3a1a4228fc64cfd85295b668c93f3b2\"\\n}\\n}\\n@staticmethod\\ndef trigger_pipeline(pipeline_name, variables=None):\\ntrigger_id = MageTrigger.OPTIONS[pipeline_name][\"trigger_id\"]\\nkey = MageTrigger.OPTIONS[pipeline_name][\"key\"]\\nendpoint = f\"http://localhost:6789/api/pipeline_schedules/{trigger_id}/pipeline_runs/{key}\"\\nheaders = {\\'Content-Type\\': \\'application/json\\'}\\npayload = {}\\nif variables is not None:\\npayload[\\'pipeline_run\\'] = {\\'variables\\': variables}\\nresponse = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, json=payload)\\nreturn response\\nMageTrigger.trigger_pipeline(\"<pipeline_name>\")\\nFinally, after the mage server is up an running, simply this command:\\npython trigger.py from mage directory in terminal.\\nCan I do data partitioning & clustering run by dbt pipeline, or I would need to do this manually in BigQuery afterwards?\\nYou can use this configuration in your DBT model:\\n{\\n\"field\": \"<field name>\",\\n\"data_type\": \"<timestamp | date | datetime | int64>\",\\n\"granularity\": \"<hour | day | month | year>\"\\n# Only required if data_type is \"int64\"\\n\"range\": {\\n\"start\": <int>,\\n\"end\": <int>,\\n\"interval\": <int>\\n}\\n}\\nand for clustering\\n{{\\nconfig(\\nmaterialized = \"table\",\\ncluster_by = \"order_id\",\\n)\\n}}\\nmore details in: https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/bigquery-configs',\n",

Delete the # and then press the Escape keyboard touch and finally press “:wq” to write (it saves your modifications) then quit.\\nYou can check that your modifications are taken into account by opening a new terminal (you can pin it to your task bar so you do not have to go to the Microsoft app each time).\\nYou will need to install pip by running this command sudo apt install python3-pip\\nNB: I had this error message when trying to install pipenv (https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/5663):\\n/sbin/ldconfig.real: Can\\'t link /usr/lib/wsl/lib/libnvoptix_loader.so.1 to libnvoptix.so.1\\n/sbin/ldconfig.real: /usr/lib/wsl/lib/libcuda.so.1 is not a symbolic link\\nSo I had to create the following symbolic link:\\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/wsl/lib/libcuda.so.1 /usr/lib64/libcuda.so\\n(Mélanie Fouesnard)',\n",

       "   {'text': 'What is the reason we don’t want to keep the docker image in our system and why do we need to run docker containers with `--rm` flag?\\nFor best practice, you don’t want to have a lot of abandoned docker images in your system. You just update it in your folder and trigger the build one more time.\\nThey consume extra space on your disk. Unless you don’t want to re-run the previously existing containers, it is better to use the `--rm` option.\\nThe right way to say: “Why do we remove the docker container in our system?”. Well the docker image is still kept; it is the container that is not kept. Upon execution, images are not modified; only containers are.\\nThe option `--rm` is for removing containers. The images remain until you remove them manually. If you don’t specify a version when building an image, it will always rebuild and replace the latest tag. `docker images` shows you all the image you have pulled or build so far.\\nDuring development and testing you usually specify `--rm` to get the containers auto removed upon exit. Otherwise they get accumulated in a stopped state, taking up space. `docker ps -a` shows you all the containers you have in your host. Each time you change Pipfile (or any file you baked into the container), you rebuild the image under the same tag or a new tag. It’s important to understand the difference between the term “docker image” and “docker container”. Image is what we build with all the resources baked in. You can move it around, maintain it in a repository, share it. Then we use the image to spin up instances of it and they are called containers.\\nAdded by Muhammad Awon',\n",

The output can be, for example, the average value of all the outputs of each model. This is called bagging.\\nXGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.\\nNote that boosting is not necessarily better than bagging.\\nMélanie Fouesnard\\nBagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.\\nBoosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max. No. of models is reached, or error is acceptably small, etc.). Boosting reduces bias & is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.\\nRileen',\n",

A few individually important features might in fact be highly correlated with others, & dropping some might be fine.

As a result, the\\nparams = space_eval(SPACE, params)\\nregister_model.py file will receive the parameters in group, while in fact it expects to receive them one by one.
