# Module 4: Monitoring

In this module, we will learn how to monitor our LLM and RAG system. We will collect, store and visualize metrics to assess the answer quality of LLMs as well as chat history and user feedback. 

## Prerequisites

Add OPENAI_API_KEY as environment variable
```
Mac/Linux: export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

* Why monitoring LLM systems?
* Monitoring answer quality of LLMs 
  * Compute different types of quality metrics
  * Store computed metrics in relational database
  * Use Grafana to visualize metrics over time
* Monitoring answer quality with user feedback
  * Store chat sessions and collect user feedback in database 
  * Connect database to Grafana to visualize user feedback and corresponding chat sessions
* What else to monitor, that is not covered by this module?
