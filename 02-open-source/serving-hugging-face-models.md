# Using Mistral-7B Model in Production

To use the Mistral-7B model from Hugging Face Hub in production without relying on the Hugging Face servers, you can download the model weights and set up a local environment to serve the model. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

### Step 1: Authenticate and Accept the User Agreement

Before downloading the model, you need to authenticate with Hugging Face and accept the user agreement for the Mistral-7B model.

1. **Create a Hugging Face account** if you don't already have one.
2. **Accept the model's user agreement** by visiting the model page on Hugging Face Hub and clicking on "Agree and Access".

### Step 2: Install Hugging Face Transformers and Other Dependencies

You need to install the `transformers` library along with `torch` (PyTorch) to download and use the model. You can install these using pip:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

### Step 3: Authenticate with Hugging Face CLI

You need to log in to the Hugging Face CLI to download the model weights.

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

Follow the instructions to authenticate using your Hugging Face credentials.

### Step 4: Download the Model

Use the `transformers` library to download the model and tokenizer. This will download the model weights to your local machine.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1"

# Download and cache the model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Save the model and tokenizer locally
model.save_pretrained("./mistral-7b-model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("./mistral-7b-tokenizer")
```

### Step 5: Load the Model Locally

Now, you can load the model from the saved directory without needing to connect to Hugging Face.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_dir = "./mistral-7b-model"
tokenizer_dir = "./mistral-7b-tokenizer"

# Load the model and tokenizer from the local directory
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_dir)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(tokenizer_dir)
```

### Step 6: Serve the Model

To serve the model in production, you can set up a web service using frameworks like Flask, FastAPI, or any other preferred web server framework. Here’s an example using FastAPI:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from pydantic import BaseModel
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

app = FastAPI()

model_dir = "./mistral-7b-model"
tokenizer_dir = "./mistral-7b-tokenizer"

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_dir)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(tokenizer_dir)

class TextGenerationRequest(BaseModel):
    text: str
    max_length: int = 50

@app.post("/generate")
async def generate_text(request: TextGenerationRequest):
    inputs = tokenizer(request.text, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model.generate(inputs["input_ids"], max_length=request.max_length)
    generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return {"generated_text": generated_text}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

### Step 7: Deploy the Service

You can deploy this FastAPI app using a web server like Uvicorn or Gunicorn, and use a process manager like Supervisor or systemd to keep it running in production. You may also consider containerizing your application using Docker for easier deployment and scalability.

### Summary

By following these steps, you can download the model weights, set up a local environment, and serve the model in production without depending on Hugging Face's servers. This ensures that your service remains available even if Hugging Face experiences downtime.
