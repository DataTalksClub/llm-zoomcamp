Checking the distribution or skewness in machine learning for regression is important because it helps in understanding skewness and how it can be applied to the distribution of the dataset. This evaluation can be done by plotting the distribution of the target variable to see if it is highly skewed.,"We can use histogram:

This means that the range of the distribution becomes larger, the mean, median, and mode may differ, and the probability of observations being on the left or right sides of the distribution may not be the same.","One of the most important characteristics of the normal distribution is that mean=median=mode, this means that the most popular value, the mean of the distribution and 50% of the sample are under the same value, this is equivalent to say that the area under the curve (black) is the same on the left and on the right. The long tail (red curve) is the result of having a few observations with high values, now the behaviour of the distribution changes, first of all, the area is different on each side and now the mean, median and mode are different. As a consequence, the mean is no longer representative, the range is larger than before and the probability of being on the left or on the right is not the same.

Mutual information score is used only for categorical or discrete variables because it calculates the relationship between such variables.

So in the homework, because the target which is median_house_value is continuous, we had to change it to binary format which in other words, makes its values discrete as either 0 or 1. If we allowed it to remain in the continuous variable format, the mutual information score could be calculated, but the algorithm would have to divide the continuous variables into bins and that would be highly subjective.

"To color the background of a pandas.DataFrame based on numerical values it contains, you can use the method `pandas.io.formats.style.Styler.background_gradient`. 

For example, to color the correlation matrix, you can use the following code:
```python
# ensure to have only numerical values in the dataframe before calling 'corr'
corr_mat = df_numerical_only.corr()
corr_mat.style.background_gradient(cmap='viridis')

This will apply a color gradient based on the values in the dataframe, with 'viridis' as the chosen color map.","The background of any dataframe can be colored (not only the correlation matrix) based on the numerical values the dataframe contains by using the method pandas.io.formats.style.Styler.background_graident.

Here an example on how to color the correlation matrix. A color map of choice can get passed, here ‘viridis’ is used.
# ensure to have only numerical values in the dataframe before calling 'corr'
corr_mat = df_numerical_only.corr()
corr_mat.style.background_gradient(cmap='viridis')

It is recommended to use DictVectorizer(sparse=True) for more memory efficiency and better convergence during fitting, especially for tasks with a high amount of classes like models of cars.","(Question by Connie S.)
The reason it's good/recommended practice to do it after splitting is to avoid data leakage - you don't want any data from the test set influencing the training stage (similarly from the validation stage in the initial training).

This process helps in selecting the best C value that optimizes the model's performance and generalization.","What does this line do?
KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=1)
If I do it inside the loop [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10] or outside the loop in Q6, HW04 it doesn't make any difference to my answers. I am wondering why and what is the right way, although it doesn't make a difference!
Did you try using a different random_state? From my understanding, KFold just makes N (which is equal to n_splits) separate pairs of datasets (train+val).
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html
In my case changing random state changed results
(Arthur Minakhmetov)
Changing the random state makes a difference in my case too, but not whether it is inside or outside the for loop. I think I have got the answer. kFold = KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle = True, random_state = 1)  is just a generator object and it contains only the information n_splits, shuffle and random_state. The k-fold splitting actually happens in the next for loop for train_idx, val_idx in kFold.split(df_full_train): . So it doesn't matter where we generate the object, before or after the first loop. It will generate the same information. But from the programming point of view, it is better to do it before the loop. No point doing it again and again inside the loop
(Bhaskar Sarma)
In case of KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=1) and C= [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10], it is better to loop through the different values of Cs as the video explained. I had separate train() and predict() functions, which were reused after dividing the dataset via KFold. The model ran about 10 minutes and provided a good score.

"ROC curves do not change with different positive to negative ratios in a test set because the ROC graph is based on the true positive rate and false positive rate, with each dimension being a strict columnar ratio. This means that the ROC curves cannot give an accurate picture of performance when there is class imbalance.","- ROC curves are appropriate when the observations are balanced between each class, whereas precision-recall curves are appropriate for imbalanced datasets.
- The reason for this recommendation is that ROC curves present an optimistic picture of the model on datasets with a class imbalance.
-This is because of the use of true negatives in the False Positive Rate in the ROC Curve and the careful avoidance of this rate in the Precision-Recall curve.
- If the proportion of positive to negative instances changes in a test set, the ROC curves will not change. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, lift and F scores use values from both columns of the confusion matrix. As a class distribution changes these measures will change as well, even if the fundamental classifier performance does not. ROC graphs are based upon TP rate and FP rate, in which each dimension is a strict columnar ratio, so cannot give an accurate picture of performance when there is class imbalance.

"The --rm flag should be used when running docker containers to prevent accumulating abandoned containers on your system, which consume extra disk space. By using the --rm option, containers are automatically removed upon exit, helping to free up storage space.","What is the reason we don’t want to keep the docker image in our system and why do we need to run docker containers with `--rm` flag?
For best practice, you don’t want to have a lot of abandoned docker images in your system. You just update it in your folder and trigger the build one more time.
They consume extra space on your disk. Unless you don’t want to re-run the previously existing containers, it is better to use the `--rm` option.
The right way to say: “Why do we remove the docker container in our system?”. Well the docker image is still kept; it is the container that is not kept. Upon execution, images are not modified; only containers are.
The option `--rm` is for removing containers. The images remain until you remove them manually. If you don’t specify a version when building an image, it will always rebuild and replace the latest tag. `docker images` shows you all the image you have pulled or build so far.
During development and testing you usually specify `--rm` to get the containers auto removed upon exit. Otherwise they get accumulated in a stopped state, taking up space. `docker ps -a` shows you all the containers you have in your host. Each time you change Pipfile (or any file you baked into the container), you rebuild the image under the same tag or a new tag. It’s important to understand the difference between the term “docker image” and “docker container”. Image is what we build with all the resources baked in.

ETA in XGBoost represents the learning rate of the model.,"Sometimes someone might wonder what eta means in the tunable hyperparameters of XGBoost and how it helps the model.
ETA is the learning rate of the model. XGBoost uses gradient descent to calculate and update the model. In gradient descent, we are looking for the minimum weights that help the model to learn the data very well. This minimum weights for the features is updated each time the model passes through the features and learns the features during training. Tuning the learning rate helps you tell the model what speed it would use in deriving the minimum for the weights.",6ffe101d,What does eta represent in XGBoost?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
The eta parameter in XGBoost affects the learning rate of the model. It helps the model determine the speed at which it derives the minimum weights for the features during training. Adjusting the learning rate with the eta parameter can impact how quickly or slowly the model converges to the optimal solution.,"Sometimes someone might wonder what eta means in the tunable hyperparameters of XGBoost and how it helps the model.

"Bagging involves training several models in parallel and combining their outputs, while boosting trains models sequentially where the previous model's error is used to train the following model. Bagging is implemented in algorithms like Random Forest, while boosting is implemented in algorithms like XGBoost. Bagging decreases variance and is robust against overfitting, while boosting reduces bias and is generally more accurate.","For ensemble algorithms, during the week 6, one bagging algorithm and one boosting algorithm were presented: Random Forest and XGBoost, respectively.
Random Forest trains several models in parallel. The output can be, for example, the average value of all the outputs of each model. This is called bagging.
XGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.
Note that boosting is not necessarily better than bagging.
Mélanie Fouesnard
Bagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.
Boosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max. No. of models is reached, or error is acceptably small, etc.). Boosting reduces bias & is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.

This will ensure you have the correct version of the wheel needed for your work.,"When running docker build -t dino-dragon-model it returns the above error
The most common source of this error in this week is because Alex video shows a version of the wheel with python 8, we need to find a wheel with the version that we are working on. In this case python 9. Another common error is to copy the link, this will also produce the same error, we need to download the raw format:

"If during testing you encounter a JSON serialization error like ""Unable to marshal response: Object of type float32 is not JSON serializable"", you should turn your response at `lambda_handler()` to a string using `str(result)` to resolve the issue.","This deployment setup can be tested locally using AWS RIE (runtime interface emulator).
Basically, if your Docker image was built upon base AWS Lambda image (FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.10) - just use certain ports for “docker run” and a certain “localhost link” for testing:
docker run -it --rm -p 9000:8080 name
This command runs the image as a container and starts up an endpoint locally at:
localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations

If this call came from a _pb2.py file, your generated code is out of date and must be regenerated with protoc >= 3.19.0.
If you cannot immediately regenerate your protos, some other possible workarounds are:
1. Downgrade the protobuf package to 3.20.x or lower.

"QUESTION: How can I avoid a pickle attribute error when using waitress with my Docker container?

ANSWER: Put the class into a separate module and import it in both the script that saves the model (e.g. train.py) and the script that loads the model (e.g. predict.py). This will resolve the issue of the pickle attribute error when using waitress with a Docker container.","When running a docker container with waitress serving the app.py for making predictions, pickle will throw an error that can't get attribute <name_of_class> on module __main__.
This does not happen when Flask is used directly, i.e. not through waitress.
The problem is that the model uses a custom column transformer class, and when the model was saved, it was saved from the __main__ module (e.g. python train.py). Pickle will reference the class in the global namespace (top-level code): __main__.<custom_class>.
When using waitress, waitress will load the predict_app module and this will call pickle.load, that will try to find __main__.<custom_class> that does not exist.
Solution:
Put the class into a separate module and import it in both the script that saves the model (e.g. train.py) and the script that loads the model (e.g. predict.py)
Note: If Flask is used (no waitress) in predict.py, and predict.py has the definition of the class, When  it is run: python predict.py, it will work because the class is in the same namespace as the one used when the model was saved (__main__).

"The problem with pickle working with Flask but not with Waitress for the custom column transformer class is due to how the class was saved and loaded.

"Based on the provided contexts, here is the answer to the question:

QUESTION: Where does pipenv create environments and how does it name them?

ANSWER: Pipenv creates environments in different locations depending on the operating system:
- OSX/Linux: ~/.local/share/virtualenvs/folder-name_cyrptic-hash
- Windows: C:\Users\<USERNAME>\.virtualenvs\folder-name_cyrptic-hash
The environment name is derived from the last folder in the folder directory where the pipenv command was used. The libraries of the environment are installed within this folder, and to activate the environment, you need to navigate back to the project folder and run `pipenv shell`. The location of the project folder serves as an identifier for the environment, instead of a specific name.","Problem: If you run pipenv install and get this message.

"The order of multiplication is important in matrix multiplication because changing the order changes the result, as matrices of different sizes and usually have different values.","When multiplying matrices, the order of multiplication is important.
For example:
A (m x n) * B (n x p) = C (m x p)

"When multiplying matrices, the order is important. Changing the order changes the result, so it is crucial to ensure that the number of columns in the 1st matrix matches the number of rows in the 2nd matrix to avoid dimension mismatches.","When multiplying matrices, the order of multiplication is important.

Baran Akın",59b4324f,What happens if I change the order in matrix multiplication?,machine-learning-zoomcamp
"The size of the resulting matrix changes with the order of multiplication. When multiplying matrices, the order of multiplication is important - changing the order changes the result. For example, when multiplying matrix A (m x n) with matrix B (n x p), the resulting matrix is C (m x p). On the other hand, multiplying matrix B (n x p) with matrix A (m x n) results in a matrix D (n x n), which is a different size compared to matrix C.","When multiplying matrices, the order of multiplication is important.

"Changing the order in matrix multiplication can have a significant impact on the result. For example, when multiplying matrix A (m x n) by matrix B (n x p), the result is matrix C (m x p). However, if you change the order and multiply B (n x p) by A (m x n), the result is matrix D (n x n), which will have different values than matrix C due to the change in order.

"No, it is not always best to train a model only on the most important features. Any feature that can offer additional predictive value should be included. It is recommended to evaluate the performance of the model with and without including certain features to determine their impact on performance.","I’m just looking back at the lessons in week 3 (churn prediction project), and lesson 3.6 talks about Feature Importance for categorical values. At 8.12, the mutual info scores show that the some features are more important than others, but then in lesson 3.10 the Logistic Regression model is trained on all of the categorical variables (see 1:35). Once we have done feature importance, is it best to train your model only on the most important features?
Not necessarily - rather, any feature that can offer additional predictive value should be included (so, e.g. predict with & without including that feature; if excluding it drops performance, keep it, else drop it). A few individually important features might in fact be highly correlated with others, & dropping some might be fine.

"QUESTION: How do I sign up?

ANSWER: To sign up for the course, you can find a link in the course GitHub repository at https://airtable.com/shryxwLd0COOEaqXo.","You can consider several different approaches:
Sampling: In the exploratory phase, you can use random samples of the data.
Chunking: When you do need all the data, you can read and process it in chunks that do fit in the memory.
Optimizing data types: Pandas’ automatic data type inference (when reading data in) might result in e.g. float64 precision being used to represent integers, which wastes space. You might achieve substantial memory reduction by optimizing the data types.
Using Dask, an open-source python project which parallelizes Numpy and Pandas.
