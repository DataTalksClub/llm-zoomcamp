Does it reference a specific line of your code?\nRestart app or server/pc.\nGoogle it, use ChatGPT, Bing AI etc.\nIt is going to be rare that you are the first to have the problem, someone out there has posted the fly issue and likely the solution.\nSearch using: <technology> <problem statement>. Example: pgcli error column c.relhasoids does not exist.\nThere are often different solutions for the same problem due to variation in environments.\nCheck the tech\u2019s documentation. Use its search if available or use the browsers search function.\nTry uninstall (this may remove the bad actor) and reinstall of application or reimplementation of action. Remember to restart the server/pc for reinstalls.\nSometimes reinstalling fails to resolve the issue but works if you uninstall first.\nPost your question to Stackoverflow. Read the Stackoverflow guide on posting good questions.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask\nThis will be your real life. Ask an expert in the future (in addition to coworkers).\nAsk in Slack\nBefore asking a question,\nCheck Pins (where the shortcut to the repo and this FAQ is located)\nUse the slack app\u2019s search function\nUse the bot @ZoomcampQABot to do the search for you\ncheck the FAQ (this document), use search [ctrl+f]\nWhen asking a question, include as much information as possible:\nWhat are you coding on?

Describe what has changed in the environment.\nProvide additional information in the same thread of the steps you have taken for resolution.\nTake a break and come back later.

You can check your current python version with: \n$ python -V(the V must be capital)\n1.

Next, you should be able to install the lib for postgres like this:\n```\n$ e\n$ pip install psycopg2_binary\n```\n3. Finally, make sure you're also installing pgcli, but use conda for that:\n```\n$ pgcli -h localhost -U root -d ny_taxisudo\n```\nThere, you should be good to go now!\nAnother solution:\nRun this\npip install \"psycopg[binary,pool]\"",

IMPORTANT: Download the Cloud Storage connector for Hadoop here: https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/concepts/connectors/cloud-storage#clusters\nAs the name implies, this .jar file is what essentially connects PySpark with your GCS\n2.) Move the .jar file to your Spark file directory. I installed Spark using homebrew on my MacOS machine and I had to create a /jars directory under \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/apache-spark/3.2.1/ (where my spark dir is located)\n3.) In your Python script, there are a few extra classes you\u2019ll have to import:\nimport pyspark\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\nfrom pyspark.conf import SparkConf\nfrom pyspark.context import SparkContext\n4.) You must set up your configurations before building your SparkSession. Here\u2019s my code snippet:\nconf = SparkConf() \\\n.setMaster('local[*]') \\\n.setAppName('test') \\\n.set(\"spark.jars\", \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/apache-spark/3.2.1/jars/gcs-connector-hadoop3-latest.jar\") \\\n.set(\"spark.hadoop.google.cloud.auth.service.account.enable\", \"true\") \\\n.set(\"spark.hadoop.google.cloud.auth.service.account.json.keyfile\", \"path/to/google_credentials.json\")\nsc = SparkContext(conf=conf)\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.AbstractFileSystem.gs.impl\",  \"com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFS\")\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.gs.impl\", \"com.google.cloud.hadoop.fs.gcs.GoogleHadoopFileSystem\")\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.gs.auth.service.account.json.keyfile\", \"path/to/google_credentials.json\")\nsc._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set(\"fs.gs.auth.service.account.enable\", \"true\")\n5.)

You just update it in your folder and trigger the build one more time.\nThey consume extra space on your disk. Unless you don\u2019t want to re-run the previously existing containers, it is better to use the `--rm` option.\nThe right way to say: \u201cWhy do we remove the docker container in our system?\u201d. Well the docker image is still kept; it is the container that is not kept. Upon execution, images are not modified; only containers are.\nThe option `--rm` is for removing containers. The images remain until you remove them manually. If you don\u2019t specify a version when building an image, it will always rebuild and replace the latest tag. `docker images` shows you all the image you have pulled or build so far.\nDuring development and testing you usually specify `--rm` to get the containers auto removed upon exit. Otherwise they get accumulated in a stopped state, taking up space. `docker ps -a` shows you all the containers you have in your host. Each time you change Pipfile (or any file you baked into the container), you rebuild the image under the same tag or a new tag. It\u2019s important to understand the difference between the term \u201cdocker image\u201d and \u201cdocker container\u201d. Image is what we build with all the resources baked in. You can move it around, maintain it in a repository, share it. Then we use the image to spin up instances of it and they are called containers.\nAdded by Muhammad Awon",

The output can be, for example, the average value of all the outputs of each model. This is called bagging.\nXGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.\nNote that boosting is not necessarily better than bagging.\nM\u00e9lanie Fouesnard\nBagging stands for \u201cBootstrap Aggregation\u201d - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.\nBoosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max. No. of models is reached, or error is acceptably small, etc.). Boosting reduces bias & is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.\nRileen",

However, there is no native way to quickly recreate this exact Evidently dashboard. You'd need to make sure you have all the relevant information logged to your Grafana data source, and then design your own plots in Grafana.\nIf you want to recreate the Evidently visualizations externally, you can export the Evidently output in JSON with include_render=True\n(more details here https://docs.evidentlyai.com/user-guide/customization/json-dict-output) and then parse information from it for your external visualization layer. To include everything you need for non-aggregated visuals, you should also add \"raw_data\": True  option (more details here https://docs.evidentlyai.com/user-guide/customization/report-data-aggregation).\nOverall, this specific plot with under- and over-performance segments is more useful during debugging, so might be easier to access it ad hoc using Evidently.\nAdded by Ming Jun, Asked by Luke, Answered by Elena Samuylova",
