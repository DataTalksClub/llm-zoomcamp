# From REST to reasoning: ingest, index, and query with dlt and Cognee

In this hands-on workshop, we'll walk through building a knowledge graph from REST API documentation using dlt and Cognee. Rather than treating APIs as flat data sources, we'll model their underlying concepts—resources, relationships, endpoints, and behaviors—as a structured graph of interconnected nodes.

* Using dlt, we'll extract and transform documentation from multiple REST APIs into structured representations. These are then embedded into a shared semantic space using Cognee, where a central ontology node anchors all inputs, linking method definitions, OpenAPI specs, and DLT-specific constructs across APIs.

* We'll explore:

* How to extract and normalize API docs into semantic node sets

* How to build and extend a central ontology that connects multiple API sources

* How to visualize and query the resulting knowledge graph to answer conceptual questions.

* By the end of the session, you'll know how to construct and query a multi-source, semantically-indexed knowledge graph, enabling a richer understanding of complex API ecosystems.

# Homework

## Q1. From the first demo, what is the "type" of the "date" node?
* Data
* Entity
* EntityType
* NodeSet

## Q2. To create a shared dictionary in cognee, we use:
* NodeSets
* Ontology
* dlt
* Relational Database

## Q3. Does dlt support partitioning your data anywhere?
* True, yes it does.
* False, no, you handle that in the database.
